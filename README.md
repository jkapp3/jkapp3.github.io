This is a GitHub account I made in CTI 110

The repository I created contains all of my website's files. This includes all
relevant HTML and CSS code, as well as assets.

I cloned the repository on my local machine by first downloading GitHub for desktop,
then I selected the repository based on the name I gave it while using GitHub in my browser.
