    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p><span data-textline-id="15" data-page-index="0">I&rsquo;m somebody who likes to learn about any and everything. As such, I have a </span> <span data-textline-id="16" data-page-index="0">wide range of things I like to do. I&rsquo;m not necessarily an expert in any one area, but I know a little</span> <span data-textline-id="17" data-page-index="0">bit about many topics. I try to stay physically and mentally active, so I work to cultivate hobbies </span> <span data-textline-id="18" data-page-index="0">and skills that can help me better myself personally. </span></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reading - I<span data-textline-id="31" data-page-index="0">&rsquo;ve been a big reader (and an even bigger book collector) for as long as I can </span> <span data-textline-id="32" data-page-index="0">remember. I used to enjoy science fiction novels, like Ender&rsquo;s Game, but during the last several </span> <span data-textline-id="33" data-page-index="0">years, I&rsquo;ve moved almost exclusively towards non-fiction.</span></li>
      </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sports - I am currently on a rec softball team, and I'm taking tennis lessons next month. In high school, I focused a lot of my energy on track and cross country. I still run and go on my elliptical to stay in shape. In the near future, I plan to try soccer and indoor rock climbing.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Podcasts - My girlfriend and I have listened to a podcast called Deep Fat Fried (DFF) for several years now. The hosts are three friends whose topics of conversation range from history, to conspiracy theories, to food. I've been listening to another podcast called Painkiller Already (PKA) that shares a lot in common with the one mentioned previously.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Politics - Ever since college, I've become more and more politically aware. I try as much as I can to stay up-to-date on the latest news and elections. It is our duty to ensure that our rights are exercised and protected. </li>
      </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>History - I've enjoyed learning about history since as far back as I can remember. My parents took me a to Civil War museum when I was a young child, and I guess that sparked an interest that's never gone away. I ended up majoring in history at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, where I got to explore diverse areas of study.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Languages - I started learning German when I was twelve because my dad told me that our family was from Germany. Since then, I've turned my eye to a wide array of languages, including Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and others. That's not to say that I'm fluent in any one of them, but I've spent my fair share of time researching languages.</li>
    </ul>
